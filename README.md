# Extension Data model for Microsoft InTune

## About

This extension allows you to integrate Microsoft InTune environments within iTop. It adds to your iTop datamodel a few 
attributes to iTop classes so that InTune managed devices and iTop objects can easily be interlinked.

For an optimal usage, this extension should be used with the "Data collector for Microsoft InTune" that will automatically and regularly discover InTune
objects in their environement and load them in iTop. This ETL will insure that your data are always up to date in iTop.

For more information about this module have a look at the
corresponding [extension documentation](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/products/combodo-azure-datamodel).

## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get a
running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss
additional modules.
